# Digital Assistant Skill for Voting

- When/what is the next election I can vote in?
- Where is my voting location?
- I have a voting question; call my county clerk.
- Who is my senator/representative?
- Call my senator/representative.
- Who won the election for [position] in [place]?

## Description of Project

_What is the scope of the business system or process? What is the overall goal of the business system or process? What is the core business problem that needs to be solved?_

AGRC’s Innovation Fund Proposal is to use voice-enabled digital assistants to make voting information more accessible to Utah citizens and, ultimately, increase engagement in the voting and political process.

In the 2016 elections in Utah, “57.7 percent of Utah's voting-eligible population cast ballots, compared with 55.5 percent in 2012, according to a report by Nonprofit Vote and the U.S. Elections Project” (http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=5066062&itype=CMSID). This statistic, discussed in a 2017 Salt Lake Tribune article, was contrasted with another statistic: “Utahns still managed to rank No. 39 nationally among the 50 states for voter turnout by all citizens of voting age — whether they are registered or not.”

The numbers in this article, as well as statistics from other sources, like the Lieutenant Governor’s Office (https://elections.utah.gov/party-and-status) show a clear disconnect between Utah’s voters and the civic engagement process. Utah voters are voting more than they ever have in the past, but as a state, we’re still behind the curve. Voting is an important way for citizens to feel heard, valued, and connected to their community, and it’s clear that Utah has an opportunity to build this connection.

## Describe the innovation or new technology associated with this project

_What business changes will be made to leverage the technology (i.e. how will we do business differently with the new technology)?_

Official voting information is currently available to Utah citizens through the vote.utah.gov website. We propose that this information be made available through Amazon Alexa devices and Google Assistant devices. The new voice-enabled digital assistants would provide a voice-based user interface design and natural language processing, along with machine learning and artificial intelligence cloud services.

The voice assistants could answer simple questions, as well as provide resources to answer more complex questions, more effectively and efficiently than users looking up information on their own. This would also help other agencies save time since they’d, hopefully, be fielding fewer calls about voting questions.

## Agencies Impacted

_Must be more than one_

Our proposed voice-enabled digital assistant project would benefit several Utah entities, especially the Lieutenant Governor’s Office, the Department of Workforce Services, and county clerks’ offices.

The assistant would be programmed to answer simple questions, based on a user’s location, such as: “Where do I vote?”; “When can I vote?”; “Who are my legislators?”; “When is the next election?”; and “Where is the closest polling location?” The assistant could also be programmed to “Call my senator/representative” or automatically call the correct county clerk (again, based on a user’s geographic location) for more complex questions that can’t be answered by the assistant.

As previously mentioned, having a voice assistant answer these simple questions would, hopefully, save time for Utah agencies, as they wouldn’t need to respond to as many calls, emails, etc. about simple, straightforward questions.

Further, this project would provide an opportunity for cross-agency collaboration. AGRC would need to work with the Lieutenant Governor’s Office and the county clerks’ offices to ensure that the assistant could provide accurate information to voters. This would also give AGRC the chance to share and gather information about how geographic information system (GIS) data is being used in relation to voting.

## Expected Cost

We expect that this project will cost approximately $25,000.

Specific tasks that could be completed with the funds include: coordination with county clerks about the most commonly asked questions by voters and how to answer those questions, so the voice services could address these topics; software development, in general; hosting costs; operations costs; and working with other agencies to enhance the accessibility of important voting data to be used by the voice services.

## Is this a new technology not currently being used

Yes. The especially unique new feature of the proposed voice services is that the information provided to users would be location based.

As the State of Utah’s map technology coordination office, AGRC has the most accurate, up-to-date GIS data related to voting, and voice services would make this data more accessible to Utah citizens. Based on our research, other states are also using voice services to provide access to general information, but the locational component we’re proposing is unique—no one else is using voice services AND GIS data to provide voting information to citizens.

These location awareness services have also not been used with virtual assistant devices in Utah. This concept is new and full of potential for assisting the people of Utah.

## Is this a substantial adaptation or modification of an existing technology

Again, the concept we’re proposing is new. However, AGRC already has APIs that we can utilize for this work; they would provide the functionality for using location data with the digital assistants.

## Describe how the implementation of this project will result in a greater efficiency in a government process or a cost saving in the delivery of a government service?

_How will improvement be measured: increased volume of work, increased quality, reduced cost, reduced risk? Is there a current baseline of performance to measure against?_

We hope that this service could save time and effort for various agencies, as it will allow for machines to answer common voting questions using natural language. This will also help the blind and visually impaired. Further, if we offer these services in multiple languages, it will increase the accessibility and reach of this information compared to current text-based websites.

But just as importantly, this service could increase Utah citizens’ engagement in the voting process. By utilizing a tool that many people are familiar with (i.e., Amazon Alexa) in this way, voting could become a more approachable task. And the natural language used by the assistant could make the presented information feel more personal to users. When users can easily access information at home, and when a natural, familiar voice is answering their questions, they might feel more listened to—more connected with their government and community.
